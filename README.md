## This Repository

The `docs` directory contains the documentation of this project.

Each component should live in it's own branch (for example `thesis`),
which should contain a single directory with it's own `.gitignore` and `README.md`.

All code should be written in English.

All documentation should first be written in Polish, so it can be reused in the thesis.
